      <description>Atium Atium is a more formal collection of some of my motion planning experiments, research ideas and paper implementations. Details of the individual implementations can be found within the subdirectories of the repo.&#xA;Repository&#xA;Manipulation Research This is a collection of manipulation algorithms for execution in simulation and a real hardware robot.&#xA;Repository&#xA;Legged Research This is a collection of algorithms for legged robots. Everything here is purely simulation in Drake.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a roboticist, currently working as a motion planning research engineer at Brain Corporation.&#xA;I have a Master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Robotics from the University of Pennsylvania. While at University, I was a part of the DAIR Lab, working on optimal control for bipedal robots.&#xA;My interests lie in enabling robots to function autonomously in the real world, using planning, optimization and learning based approaches.&#xA;Brief descriptions of some of my projects can be found here.</description>
