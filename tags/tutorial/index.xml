      <description>&lt;!-- Post 7 --&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at how we can set up a framework for streamlined simulation and hardware control of a manipulator. The robot under consideration is Ufactory&amp;rsquo;s Lite6 manipulator and the simulation/setup tool used is Drake.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All the code used in this post can be found in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/shrenikm/manipulation_research&#34;&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt;. But before we start, some explanations are in order.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lite6?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ufactory.cc/lite-6-collaborative-robot/&#34;&gt;Lite6&lt;/a&gt; is one of the more economical (not to be confused with cheap) manipulators one can buy, especially for personal research where you&amp;rsquo;re not going to be spending tens of thousands of dollars on some of the more well established robots out there. It&amp;rsquo;s well built, has surprisingly good specifications for the price point, and comes with an integrated controller. You can get a parallel and vacuum gripper for it, but also comes with hardware interfaces that can support custom grippers. The product is well supported and their API (python and C++) is easy to use. The main pain point is its parallel gripper, which can only open by 1.6 cm. This severely limits the type of objects you can pick/place, but luckily for us, pick and place is only a small part of robotic manipulation!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
