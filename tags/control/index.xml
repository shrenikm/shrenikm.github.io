      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at how we can set up a framework for streamlined simulation and hardware control of a manipulator. The robot under consideration is Ufactory&amp;rsquo;s Lite6 manipulator and the simulation/setup tool used is Drake.&#xA;All the code used in this post can be found in my repo. But before we start, some explanations are in order.&#xA;Lite6?&#xA;The Lite6 is one of the more economical (not to be confused with cheap) manipulators one can buy, especially for personal research where you&amp;rsquo;re not going to be spending tens of thousands of dollars on some of the more well established robots out there.</description>

      <description>TrajOpt $[1]$ is an optimization based approach for motion planning. More specifically, it uses a sequential convex optimization procedure along with a formulation of collision constraints to find locally optimal planning trajectories, even for robotic systems that have a large number of degrees of freedom.&#xA;This post will go into the details of the optimization part, and give an outline of how it can be implemented. My implementation can be found here</description>
